		<br/><p> Hello there! Below is an interactive program designed to tell you the average amounts of nutrients and water a pet may need. You can scroll down to try this out! </p><br/>
		<br/>
		<br/><p> Make sure you select the interactive mode! Type your answers exactly as you see them in the question and take into consideration that each pet has its own dietary needs and could need more or less nutrients and/or water depending on where it lives. </p><br/>

		<br/><p> My name is Grace and I'm an eigth grader from Hortonville Middle School. I love challenges and I tend to soak up everything I can about everything I can. I enjoy reading a variety of genres as well as writing a variety of genres, though I consider music to be my strong front. While I don't have any pets, I love having animals around me... Especially farm animals. They always seem to have a bit of happy-go-lucky and freedom in their souls and it's really contagious! </p><br/>
