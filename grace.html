		<br/><p> Hello there! Below is an interactive program designed to tell you the average amounts of nutrients and water a pet like a cat, dog, horse, goldfish, bird, and a bearded-dragon may need. You can scroll down to try this out! Make sure you select the interactive mode! Type your answers exactly as you see them in the question and take into consideration that each pet has its own dietary needs and could need more or less nutrients and/or water depending on where it lives, its health, breed, and/or age. I hope you enjoy! </p><br/>
